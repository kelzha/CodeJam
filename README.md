McGill CodeJam 2014
====================

Mcgill Code Jam AI project. [Link to event](http://allevents.in/montreal/codejam-2014-artificial-intelligence/291428617724257#)

The goal was to develop and implement a facial detection and recognition algorithm. Given a database of pictures and IDs, 
the algorithm must be able to recognize a novel picture:
* The ID is output if the picture contains someone from the database
* "No match" is output if the picture does not contain a person or if the person is not in the database
